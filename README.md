#  Hands-On-Lab: Containers with Docker

## About this exercise set

> To help the users of this exercise to learn how to use docker and where to get help when they are stuck in the real world, I have tried to create exercises that forces the user to look in documentation and experiment.
>
> **This means, that the exercise set is not a simple copy & paste exercise**
